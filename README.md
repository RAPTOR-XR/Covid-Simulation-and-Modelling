# Covid-Simulation-and-Modelling
All national governments and the World Health Organization have heavily relied on modeling to determine the most effective COVID-19 effect mitigation techniques. These have primarily been epidemiological models designed to comprehend
the diseaseâ€™s spread and the effects of various therapies. But
in addition to issues with disease transmission, a worldwide
pandemic raises many other issues and challenges, each of which
needs a unique model to determine the best approach. In this
paper, I address the difficulties brought on by the COVID-19
pandemic and how simulation modeling might assist in assisting
decision-makers in making the best judgments possible.
